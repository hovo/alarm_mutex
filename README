1. To compile the program "My_Alarm.c", use the following command:

   make

2. To run the executable code, use the following command:

   ./My_Alarm

3. When running the executable code, you will notice instructions. Accordingly,
   type in the number of seconds at which the alarm should expire, followed by
   the text of the message. Note that the number of seconds is an integer.

   For example:

   2 Good Morning!

   (To exit from the program, type Ctrl+D.)

4. To read the output from the testing procedures, use the following command:

   cat Test_output

Disclaimer: Some alternate inputs will be dealt with accordingly.

            Input: 9.8
            Will be treated as: 9 = number of seconds; .8 = message;

            Input: 9Hello!
            Will be treated as: 9 = number of seconds; Hello! = message;
